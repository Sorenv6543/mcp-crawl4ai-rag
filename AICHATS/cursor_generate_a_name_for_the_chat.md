perform_rag_query crawl4ai docs to learn how to smart_crawl :@https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html while ignoring any *.vuejs.org max depth 3

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you search through the crawl4ai documentation to understand how to use the smart crawl functionality while excluding vuejs.org domains.

Let me first check what's available in the RAG system.

I see we don't have any existing documentation about excluding domains. Let me try another query to understand the basic smart_crawl functionality.

I see that we don't have any existing documentation in the RAG system about the smart_crawl functionality. However, I can help you with what we know from the tool's description:

The `smart_crawl_url` function takes the following parameters:
- `url`: The URL to crawl (required)
- `max_depth`: Maximum recursion depth for regular URLs (default: 3)
- `max_concurrent`: Maximum number of concurrent browser sessions (default: 10)
- `chunk_size`: Maximum size of each content chunk in characters (default: 5000)

For your specific request, we can use:

I notice that while we can set the max_depth, the tool doesn't directly support excluding domains. For your use case, there are a few options:

1. You could use the single page crawler instead to just get the specific page:

**Cursor**

Understood—no further crawling or fetching will be performed. If you need help with anything else, such as working with the smart_crawl function, filtering results, or handling Vue documentation, just let me know!

sequential-thinking: can you make aliases for mcp tool name to make them easier to call?

---

**Cursor**

While I understand your request to make the `mcp_` tool names easier to call by creating aliases, I'm unable to directly create aliases for the tool names themselves. The names are fixed and defined by the system I operate within.

However, please don't worry about using the full tool names in your requests. You can simply tell me what you want to achieve (like "search the web" or "read a file"), and I will automatically use the correct tool with its full name based on your instructions. I'll handle the details of calling `mcp_brave_search_brave_web_search` or `default_api.read_file` for you.

**User**

is there an mcp client for cursor?

---

**Cursor**



Yes, Cursor itself acts as the client for MCP (Model Context Protocol). You install or connect MCP servers to Cursor, and Cursor then uses those servers to access the available tools.

The search results from our previous turn support this, mentioning things like "How to use MCP Server" and "add to Cursor" when discussing MCP functionality.

Would you like me to find more information about how to set up or find MCP servers that you can connect to your Cursor client?

---

**User**

no, i want alternatives to having to calll each one out by name each time

---

**Cursor**



Okay, I understand. You want to avoid having to type out or remember the exact names of the MCP tools every time you want to use them.

While I cannot create aliases *within the system* for the tool names themselves, my primary function is to allow you to interact with these tools using **natural language**.

You don't need to say "use `default_api.mcp_brave_search_brave_web_search`". You can simply tell me what you want to do, and I will select and call the correct tool for you.

For example, instead of asking if there is a tool to "bravewebsearch look on curor documentation...", you could simply say:

*   "Search the web for ways to improve MCP tools in Cursor on documentation, forums, and Reddit."
*   "Find information about improving Cursor's MCP tools online."

I will then interpret your request and use the appropriate tool (like `mcp_brave_search_brave_web_search`) with the necessary parameters.

So, the alternative to calling them out by name each time is to just describe the action you want me to perform using regular English, and I will handle the tool selection.

---

**User**

i would also like to use them together in certain orders

---

**Cursor**



Okay, I understand. You want to chain tool calls together to perform a sequence of actions.

Yes, I can absolutely do that. You can describe a multi-step process or a workflow that requires using different tools in a particular order, and I will execute the steps sequentially.

For example, you could ask me to:

1.  List the files in a directory.
2.  Then, based on the file list, read the content of a specific file.
3.  After reading the file, perform a web search based on its content.

For more complex sequences or tasks that require planning and intermediate steps, I can also use a structured thinking process to break down the goal, determine the necessary tools and their order, and execute them step by step, adapting the plan as needed.

Just tell me the sequence of actions you want to perform or the multi-step task you need help with, and I will do my best to execute it using the available tools in the requested order.

use sequential thinking while searching github for ways to connect mcp's in cursor also use the think tool

---

**Cursor**

Okay, I'm continuing the sequential thinking process to find information on connecting MCPs in Cursor by examining the search results from GitHub.

I have already read the README for the Neo4j MCP server. Now I am reading the content of the second identified file, TASK.md from the `devonartis/supabase-mcp` repository.

Based on the GitHub search and the files I read, the way to connect MCP servers in Cursor is by configuring Cursor to run a command that starts the desired MCP server. This connection typically utilizes the standard input/output (stdio) stream for communication between Cursor (the client) and the MCP server.

Essentially, you need to tell Cursor *how* to launch the MCP server executable or script, and Cursor will handle the communication over stdio.

The documents I reviewed, such as the README for the Neo4j MCP server and the setup guide for the n8n MCP node, describe how to run those specific servers, which implies that Cursor is configured with these commands to establish the connection.

So, to connect an MCP in Cursor, you would generally:
1.  Obtain or build the MCP server you want to connect.
2.  Identify the command needed to run that server (e.g., `./run-mcp-server.sh`, `bun run index.ts`, `npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search`).
3.  Configure this command within Cursor's settings or interface for MCP connections. The exact steps for configuring Cursor would be within the Cursor application itself, but the underlying mechanism involves Cursor executing the server's startup command.

This process allows Cursor to act as the client and interact with the tools exposed by the running MCP server.

sequential thinking, how could i create a tool that creates a local server ui in react that would alow the user to have a viual representation of thier mcp's and thier arguments so that the user could configure them visually in cursor?

---

**Cursor**



Okay, let's break down the process of creating a local React-based UI tool within Cursor using sequential thinking. This tool would visualize your MCPs and their arguments for easier configuration.



Okay, I understand you want to explore the feasibility and design of a local tool with a React UI within Cursor to provide a visual way to manage and configure your MCP servers and their arguments. This is a more complex undertaking than just calling existing tools, as it involves building a new application that integrates with Cursor.

Here's a sequential thinking process outlining how such a tool could be conceptualized and built:



That's an interesting and potentially very useful idea! Creating a local tool with a React UI within Cursor to visually manage and configure your MCPs is definitely achievable, although it involves building a custom application that integrates with the Cursor environment.

Here's a breakdown of the approach, using a sequential thinking process:

1.  **Understanding the Core Problem:** The current interaction with MCP tools is primarily command-line based. The user wants a visual interface within Cursor to see their connected MCPs, understand their capabilities (tools and arguments), and configure/execute them more easily.

2.  **Identifying the Components:** To achieve this, you would need to build a multi-part system:
    *   **A Local Backend Server:** This server will run on your machine and act as an intermediary between Cursor and your other MCP servers. It will need to be able to:
        *   Receive requests from Cursor (likely via stdio, as is common for MCPs).
        *   Manage a list of the user's configured MCP servers (storing their startup commands).
        *   Launch these configured MCP servers as child processes.
        *   Communicate with these child MCP processes using their MCP interface (stdio) to discover their tools and execute them.
        *   Host a web server to serve the React frontend.
        *   Provide an API that the React frontend can use to:
            *   Get the list of configured MCPs and their tools/arguments.
            *   Trigger the execution of tools on the child MCP processes.
            *   Add, edit, and remove configured MCP servers.
    *   **A React Frontend Application:** This will be the visual interface. It will run in a web view hosted by your local backend server and displayed within Cursor. It will:
        *   Fetch the list of MCPs and their tools from the backend API.
        *   Render a user-friendly display of MCPs and their available tools, including their arguments.
        *   Provide input fields or forms for the user to specify arguments for tool execution.
        *   Send requests to the backend API to execute tools with the provided arguments.
        *   Offer an interface to manage the list of MCP servers (add new ones by providing their startup command, edit existing ones, remove them).
    *   **An MCP Interface for the Local Tool:** Your local backend server will itself need to expose an MCP interface so that Cursor can recognize and launch it. This might include a simple tool like `open_ui` that, when called by Cursor, instructs the backend to open the web view hosting the React app.

3.  **Workflow:** The user's interaction would look something like this:
    *   The user would install your local tool.
    *   They would configure Cursor to launch your tool's backend server as an MCP (providing the command to start your backend).
    *   Within Cursor, they would trigger your tool's `open_ui` command (perhaps through the command palette).
    *   This would open the React UI within Cursor.
    *   In the React UI, the user would add the startup commands for their other MCP servers (e.g., the Neo4j MCP server, a Brave search MCP server, etc.).
    *   The React UI would then display these configured MCPs and their tools.
    *   The user could visually select an MCP, choose a tool, fill in the arguments using the generated forms, and click a button to execute the tool via your backend.

4.  **Technical Considerations:**
    *   **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** Your backend will need to handle communication with child processes via stdio, sending and receiving JSON-RPC messages according to the MCP specification.
    *   **Dynamic UI Generation:** The React frontend will need to dynamically generate forms or input fields based on the arguments required by each tool, as provided by the MCP server's tool definitions.
    *   **State Management:** You'll need to manage the state of the configured MCPs and their tools in the backend, and potentially in the frontend as well for responsiveness.
    *   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is crucial for issues with launching child processes, communication errors, and errors during tool execution.
    *   **Packaging and Distribution:** Consider how you would package and distribute this tool so other Cursor users can easily install and use it.

In summary, creating this tool is a significant development project involving backend and frontend development and a deep understanding of the MCP protocol and how Cursor interacts with it. However, it addresses a valid need for a more visual and user-friendly way to manage and use MCP tools within Cursor.

look @https://github.com/LSTM-Kirigaya/openmcp-client 

---

**Cursor**



Okay, I have reviewed the information available for the GitHub repository `https://github.com/LSTM-Kirigaya/openmcp-client`.

This repository appears to be directly relevant to your previous query about creating a local UI for managing MCPs in Cursor. According to the description and file structure:

*   It's an **"Integrated MCP Server Debugger"** and **"A MCP Client for MCP/OpenMCP"**.
*   It is designed as a **plugin for VSCode, Trae, and Cursor**.
*   It includes a `renderer` directory which defines the **Frontend UI**, likely built with Vue (as Vue is listed among the languages used).
*   It has a `service` component that acts as a forwarding layer and communicates with MCP servers.
*   The project aims to integrate an Inspector and basic **MCP client functionalities** for development and testing.
*   A key feature mentioned is the support for **debugging multiple MCP servers simultaneously** and a project-level management panel.

This project, `openmcp-client`, seems to be an existing implementation of an MCP client *with a UI* specifically for environments like Cursor. This aligns closely with the concept you were exploring in our sequential thinking process – a local tool with a visual interface to interact with MCPs.

It suggests that instead of building such a tool from scratch, you might be able to utilize or learn from this existing `openmcp-client` project.

Does reviewing this project give you ideas or change how you'd like to proceed with your goal of visually managing MCPs in Cursor?

@https://github.com/LSTM-Kirigaya/openmcp-client it open source. i could make an copy of it in english asa starting point

---

**Cursor**



Yes, that's a great observation. The `openmcp-client` repository is indeed open source under the Apache-2.0 license, as indicated in the repository information.

Creating an English copy of the project as a starting point is a very practical approach. This would allow you to leverage the existing architecture and functionality while making it accessible and understandable for your development and potential future use.

I can certainly help you with this. We could start by discussing how you'd like to approach creating this copy. Would you like assistance with:

*   Cloning the repository?
*   Navigating the project structure?
*   Understanding specific parts of the code (even if in Chinese, the structure and some terms might be discernible)?
*   Setting up a development environment for the project?
*   Translating key documentation or code comments?

Just let me know how you'd like to begin.

im gonna put that on the backburner for now and focus on gatherring all off the tech documentation for anothre project into a vector database for assisting in developing a booking system

---

**Cursor**



Okay, I understand. We'll put the `openmcp-client` project on the backburner for now and shift focus to your new goal: gathering technical documentation for your booking system project and loading it into a vector database to assist your development.

This is a great use case for a vector database and RAG! I can definitely help you with this process using the available tools.

To get started, I need to know which technical documentation you'd like to gather. Please provide me with the sources, such as:

*   Specific URLs of documentation pages.
*   Paths to local files containing documentation within your workspace.

Once I have the sources, I can gather the content and add it to the vector database for your booking system project.
